# crypto-viewer
This project is to demonstrate how to create MVVM structure android app, using life cycle extension (ViewModels) and Retrofit.
The application retrieves cryptocurrency prices and market cap and other details from https://api.coinranking.com/

I've used additional tools like:

spark: to display the line form of the 24H fluctuation of the coin's price

GlideToVectorYou: to load SVG images inside an ImageView
